INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR NITOS SCHEDULER

NITOS scheduler has the following workflow.

1. At 28 and 58 minute the file reservations_check.rb located in /sbin is executed. (as cron job through /etc/crontab file)

2. This script checks the scheduler database for ending reservations and deactivates them. After that checks for starting reservations 
   and activates them (The activation/deactivation is actually an omf_create_psnode command for OMF).

3. Scheduler runs periodically the frequencies_check.rb script to check for frequency misuse. A parser could be used at the log file 
   that the script makes, in order to enforce the usage policy you have.

HOW TO INSTALL NITOS SCHEDULER

1. Import the scheduler's database tables in your mysql (scheduler_db.sql). Note that:
	- jos_users is the table for users.
	- node_list is the table for nodes.
	- spectrum is the table for frequencies.
	- slices is the table for slices.
	- reservations is the table for reservation of nodes.
	- spec_reserve is the table for reservation of frequencies.
	- users_slices is the table for the association between users and slices.

2. Fill the tables with the correct info (the columns type,floor,view,wall,x,z in node_list are not used. y should be the number of the node 
   e.x. 4 for node004). (username in reservation and spec_reserve is actually the slice_name.)


   e.x.		id 	name 	type 	floor 	view 	wall 	x 	y 	z
		8 	node001 orbit 	4 	outside front 	1 	1 	4

	 	id 	modulation 	channel frequency
		1 	IEEE802_11a 	36 	5180

3. Copy the files located to the package's sbin folder at your /sbin folder.

4. Insert the MySql username and password to the reservations_check.rb script in line 44.

5. Copy the files located to the package's bin folder at your /bin folder. chmod them with 755 in order to get executables.

6. Make a new "scheduler" user. 
	$ useradd -m -d /home/scheduler -s /bin/bash scheduler
	$ sudo -u scheduler ssh-keygen -t rsa 

8. Copy frequencies_check.rb to scheduler's home folder. Open it and insert username and password for MySql database.

9. Run create_slice script for all your users. (Remember to comment useradd command in case they have already a command line account in your server)

10. Copy crontab file to /etc/ and restart crontab.

11. Copy the files located to the /root folder at your /root folder.

11. Every user should copy server's root public key to the authorized_keys file in the node's image file system. (This is required in order to check the frequencies)
